- Basic list operations (add, remove, get, set)
- Iterator implementation
- Size tracking and empty state checking
- Modification count tracking for fail-fast iteration

## Test Coverage

The implementation includes extensive test coverage for:

- Basic iterations (empty list, single element, multiple elements)
- Size tracking and modification count
- Iterator operations
- Edge cases and error conditions
